# Ad-hoc chat

This is an Ad-hoc chat built for the module Network Systems at the university.

The packets need to be sent with UDP Multicast.


#### Features:
- [Protobufs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to serialize the packets that need to be sent.
- Qt5 for GUI, networking and inter-communication of different layers.
- [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) for node synchronisation.
